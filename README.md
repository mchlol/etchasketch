# etchasketch
<br>
The task is to build an etchasketch-like drawing grid, where the cells change when a user hovers over with their mouse.<br>
I'm calling my project "Pixel Sketchpad" because I never had an etchasketch as a kid and I don't know what that is. I had MS Paint and drawing scribbles on deposit slips at the bank.<br>
I've learned:<br>
<li>More about event listeners - this project uses a click event and mouseover.</li>
<li>Adding multiple css styles to an element at once - I did this using cssText.</li>
<li>To use git fetch after merging a branch into main!</li>
